I aspire to deliver new value to humanity through the integration of hardware and software. To this end, I majored in [Mechanical Engineering](https://mech.skku.edu/me/index.do) and [Software Engineering](https://cse.skku.edu/cse/index.do). I have developed my programming skills through work at `Kakao Style`, `Samsung Electronics`, `manufacturing SMEs`, and `startups`. I also enhanced my research skills while working as an undergraduate research assistant in the `Automation Lab` and `AIFactory Lab`.

During my service as a `KATUSA` (Korean Augmentation to the United States Army), I maintained good relations with the U.S. military. I have experience in engaging in business-like conversations, including serving as a training instructor.
